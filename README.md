## About The Project

You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument.

You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.
If ever there are several solutions, you have to represent only the highest square. 

If they are still several solutions, choose the square to the left.

## Usage

./bsq -h

./bsq [map]
